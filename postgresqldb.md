PostgreSQL is a relational database management system and the official website for this database is: https://www.postgresql.org/. This is an open source database that uses a relational data model. The hosting models for PostgreSQL include client/server: across the network, and cloud: extension of client server. Java is able to access the PostgreSQL database using the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API, which is a standard way for Java to interact with relational databases. In order to use JDBC, the user would need to add the PostgreSQL JDBC driver to their project, the driver can be found on the official website. Python can access PostgreSQL through the use of the psycopg2 library. The psycopg2 is a PostgreSQL adapter for Python which is able to implement the Python Database API.
