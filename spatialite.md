# SpatiaLite

 SpatiaLite is a spatial database that is built upon the SQLite database engine and the official website for this database is: https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index. This is an open source database that uses a spatial data model which supports spatial data types and spatial SQL allowing for the story, query, and manipulation of geospatial data. The hosting model for SpatiaLite can be local, client/server, cloud, as well as embedded. Java is able to access the SpatiaLite Database using JDBC(Java Database Connectivity). Users can download the SpatiaLite JDBC driver and include it in their application. Python is able to access SpatiaLite using the 'sqlite3' module. Users will need to download the SpatiaLite library and the corresponding Python bindings and include them in the Python environment.

 This database is different from the other databases because it is purely focused on managing spatial data and it is not able to provide the broader range of data management and manipulation that the other databases can provide, specifically the purposes that relational database management systems can provide. 

The information for the information above can be found on the official website.
