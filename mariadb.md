# MariaDB

Microsoft SQL Server is a popular relational database management system and the official website for this database is: https://mariadb.org/. This is an open source database that uses a relational data model. The hosting models for MariaDB include client/server: across the network, and cloud: extension of client server. Java is able to access the MariaDB using the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API. In order to use JDBC, the user would need to add the JDBC driver to their project, the driver can be found on the official website. Python can access MariaDB using a module called the 'mysql-connector-python', which is an open-source Python module that provides access to MySQL and MariaDB databases. Users can install the module in their command prompt or terminal and import the module in Python.
