The hosting models for MongoDB include client/server: across the network, and cloud: extension of client server. Java is able to access MongoDB through it's official Java driver. The driver provides a high-level API for Java to interact with the database. Once the driver is added the project you are working on, you can create a connection to the MongoDB server using a class. Python is also able to access MongoDB through an official driver. The driver for Python is available as a package in the Python Package Index. After the driver is installed, a user can access MongoDB with a similar process as someone using the Java driver.
